# Build and Destroy

An augmented reality building block game
BlockBuilder AR allows you to build towers with colorful building blocks, utilizing object physics to bring the creations to life. You can add blocks and change their colors. Grab and move them around by moving your device. When you're done with your creation, switch on gravity and watch it fall into place. BlockBuilder features two destruction objects: a ball to throw at your tower from different angles, or a car that races toward your tower for a more dramatic destruction.

## How to use the app
   **First** enter 
   ```npm i```
   ```npm run build``` 
   into your command line inside of the downloaded directory.

## How to make changes to the script
   After each change in the index.js file, run ```npm run build``` again, and the script.js will be created with your updates.
   

## How to play
   In order to spawn a block, press the new block button. To place it, either tap the block to make it freeze where it is, add another block, or turn on gravity. Pressing the gravity button again will make the block positions reset to their pre-gravity locations. The reset button will clear all the blocks in the scene. 
   Once gravity is turned on a selection of destructions objects will apear. The car can be dragged around the screen to line it up, and tapping the screen will send it vrooming forward. The ball will stay fixed in front of the user until the screen is tapped, and it will be thrown in the direction it's being pointed.
